<p>The user can run the tool by selecting either to see all scenarios 
                        or to see a single scenario. The colors of parcels indicate when 
                        these should be harvested. The ‘Do nothing’ option corresponds to 
                        stands that should be left not harvested during the whole planning horizon. </p>
                    <p>The user can select a specific period by clicking on the legend. 
                        Once a period on the legend is selected, only parcels that are 
                        assigned to be harvested in that period are highlighted. 
                        Clicking back the period on the legend brings back all the 
                        periods and the whole color scale. The map can be zommed in 
                        or out by scrolling using the mouse wheel. Similarly, the 
                        user can pan the map in the whole zone assigned for its display. </p>
                    <p>On the left there is a graph that refers to the total volume 
                        harvested in each period for such a proposed forest management 
                        planning. The chart can refer to a single scenario or all the scenarios </p>
                    <p>There is a tooltip for both the chart and the map(s). The tooltip
                         gives the attribute of the map such as the area, the period 
                         scheduled for harvest and which scenario are we referring to. 
                         The bar chart tooltip allows to see exactly what is the volume 
                         harvested in each period. </p>
                    <p>When visualizing a single scenario, there is a slider to navigate 
                        between scenarios. Changing the position of the slider select a 
                        different scenario. The slider disappears when the user toggles 
                        to all scenarios. </p>
                    <p> ‘All scenarios’ option allows to see simultaneously the volume 
                        of wood harvested in all the planning period and the stands 
                        allocated for harvest in each planning period. So we will have 
                        8 maps corresponding each to a scenario. The bar chart displays 
                        as well the volumes for each scenario and period. </p>
                    <p>The user can choose to see either the ‘wait and see’ case which 
                        is the management we would propose if we knew the given scenario 
                        would manifest itself for sure or the ‘final’ case which integrated 
                        the stochasticity in the climate and allows a management that anticipates 
                        climate change. </p>
                    <p>One can decide to better decipher the solution by visualizing it as a 
                        parallel coordinate. The parallel coordinate shows for each stand how 
                        it is scheduled to be harvest in each scenario. The user can hover over
                         each line to see how it changes. You can select a set of parcels by 
                         dragging around the axe and it selects the group of parcels</p>
                    <p>The user has the choice to compare the scenarios two by two by 
                        checking ‘compare two scenarios’ checkbox. The comparison is
                         flexible and works either it is one scenario or all scenarios 
                         selected; either it is all periods or one period selected as
                          well as wait and see solutions or the final solution. </p>
